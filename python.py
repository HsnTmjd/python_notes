what we have to do is do primt("hello" + the variable)

the output will be like_
 hello _____
"""
print("Nice to meet you" + x)
"""
    But this time the output is like_
    "Nice to meet you tamjid"
    we can add a space ourselves like "print("nice to meet you " + x)"
    We cam see that there is no space between the printed text and the variable.
    So what we have to do is use another operator. We are going to use"," instead of the "+"

"""
#This time the "," operator automatically adds the space between the printed text and the input

print("Nice to meet you" , x)

#another way to solve this problem is ' end="/n" ' this attribute means the output will go to the next line immidiately
#If we use ' end="" ' then it'll mean the next input will be in the same line.

print("Nice to meet you " , end="")
print(x)
"""
This time the "," operator is used in using not just one but two arguements in the print function recall that they magically had a space betweem them
Also it adds the needed space by deffault

"""
    actual use of end=""_
        It actually means the next line of the program will be printed at the line.
        if we just use end="", then we wont find any space between them.
        But if we use end=" ", then we will find a space.
        If we use end="123", then we will find 123 between them.
        Also if we want to use end="" but still we want to make a separate line, then we have to use end="/n"

        that you want the round function to round two you specify it here by adding a comma and then that number.
    So if we read the documentation if you don't specify a number of digits you just specify the number to round it, it rounds to the nearest integer.
        But suppose we want it round to the tenths place or the hundredths place that is one pr two digits after the decimal point we additionally pass im  ", 1"/", 2" to be more precise.

# Here we are introducing a new function called 'for'

for student in students:

"""
    The for loop in Python is a powerful control flow statement that allows you to iterate over elements in a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or any iterable object. It simplifies the process of performing repetitive tasks, such as printing elements in a list, without the need to write the code manually for each item in the sequence.

In your example, the for loop is used to iterate over the students list and print each student's name one by one. Here's how the loop works:

The loop starts with the keyword for, followed by a variable name (student in this case), the keyword in, and then the iterable object (students in this case). The variable student takes on the value of each element in the students list during each iteration of the loop.

The loop then executes the indented block of code below it, which simply prints the value of the student variable in each iteration. As a result, it will print each student's name on a separate line:
"""
# We said before that we could use '_', but we can't use it now. Because we are using the variable right now.




students = ["Hermione", "Harry", "Ron"]
for i in range(len(students)):
    print(students[i])

"""
    Now that we have introduced a new function called len(). Let's define it.

    The len() function is used to find out how many items are in a collection like a list, string, or dictionary. It tells you the length of the collection.

    For example1_
        text = "Hello"
        print(len(text))
    output_
        5
    For example2_
        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        print(len(numbers))
    output_
        5
    For example3_
        grades = {"John": 85, "Alice": 92, "Bob": 78}
        print(len(grades))
    output_
        3

    In each example, the len() function tells you the number of items in the given collection.

"""
# Now we are using it in the loop
# Here the len(students) determines the number of items in the students list.
# Then we are puting the len(students) into the range function. Then it printed the list as usual.

"""
    Here, you use a for loop to go through the elements of the students list. range(len(students)) generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to one less than the length of the students list.

    len(students) returns the length of the students list, which is 3 in this case. So, range(len(students)) is equivalent to range(3), which generates the sequence [0, 1, 2].

    In the for loop, the variable i takes on each value from the sequence [0, 1, 2] one by one during each iteration of the loop.

    Inside the loop, students[i] is used to access the elements of the students list using the index i. Since i takes on the values [0, 1, 2], it will access the elements "Hermione", "Harry", and "Ron" respectively.

    The loop then executes the print(students[i]) statement for each iteration, which prints the name of each student on a separate line.
    This code achieves the same result as the simpler for student in students: loop that we discussed earlier. However, using range(len(students)) is less common and less Pythonic in this specific scenario. It's generally preferred to directly use the more readable and straightforward for student in students: loop to iterate over elements in a list.

"""

# So, we could also print it like this_
students = ["Hermione", "Harry", "Ron"]
for i in [0,1,3]:
    print(students[i])
# Inside the loop, students[i] is used to access the elements of the students list using the index i. So, it prints the names "Hermione", "Harry", and "Ron" one by one. also in that order.

# Let's print out not just names of students but rather let's print i first and then the student at location i.
# So two things. We know that print can take two arguements.
students = ["Hermione", "Harry", "Ron"]
for i in range(len(students)):
    print(i , students[i])

# Now we see that Hermione is the top student and she is in the zeroth place and that's a little weird. We want the rank to be like 1,2,3
# So we just have to do 'i + 1'

"""
    As I was writing the notes I faced a new problem. I wanted the output to be like_
0 Hermione
1 Harry
2 Ron
1 Hermione
2 Harry
3 Ron

    But as we coded the following_
    students = ["Hermione", "Harry", "Ron"]
    for i in range(len(students)):
    print(i , students[i])
    print(i + 1, students[i])

    We got the following result_
    0 Hermione
    1 Hermione
    1 Harry
    2 Harry
    2 Ron
    3 Ron

    What is the problem then?
    Explanation:
In the code above, the for loop iterates over the indices [0, 1, 2] generated by range(len(students)).

During each iteration, the print statements are executed twice:

print(i, students[i]): This prints the current index i and the corresponding student's name from the students list.

print(i + 1, students[i]): This prints the current index i + 1 and the same student's name again.

You need to modify the loop and the print statements like this:


"""
students = ["Hermione", "Harry", "Ron"]
for i in range(len(students)):
    print(i, students[i])
for i in range(len(students)):
    print(i + 1, students[i])

"""

        2. Then we are defining the "print_column". Then we are typing "for _ in range(height):" and earliar we typed "print_column(3)".
            So right here it'll be programmed "height = 3"

    What we did here is_
        instead of creating a new function we used 'print("#\n" * height, end="")'.
        Because height = 3, so '#\n" * height, end=""' means it'll multiplied by 3 and give the output on that order.

main()

"""
    Inside the print_square() function, there are two nested loops that work together to print the square.
    The outer loop, for i in range(size):, iterates over each row of the square based on the given size.

    The inner loop, for j in range(size):, iterates over each brick within the current row.

    Inside the inner loop, the code prints a single brick using the print("#", end="") statement.
    The end="" argument ensures that the print statements within the same row are concatenated without adding a newline character at the end.

"""
"""
    How the program works_
        1. As usual, 'size' = 3.
        2. We defined the function 'print_square'.
        3. For i in range(3), the program will enter another inner loop.
        4. Then it'll print '###'. After that it'll go to the next line and also it'll be blank.
        5. Again it'll go back to the start of the loop and again print '###'.
    If we use end=" "_
        Then the output will be like_

# Introduction to import.
# How do we load a module into our own program so that we can use functions in that module.
# For that we need a new keyword in python and it is import.

import random

coin = random.choice(['Heads', 'tails'])
print(coin)
"""
Here's a breakdown of the code:

import random: This line imports the random module, which provides various functions for generating random values.

coin = random.choice(['Heads', 'Tails']): This line uses the random.choice() function to randomly select an element from the list ['Heads', 'Tails']. This simulates the flipping of a coin with two possible outcomes: "Heads" or "Tails". The selected outcome is stored in the variable coin.

print(coin): This line prints the value stored in the coin variable, which represents the outcome of the coin flip (either "Heads" or "Tails").

When you run this code, it will randomly choose either "Heads" or "Tails" and print that chosen outcome. Since the random.choice() function is used, the result is not deterministic, meaning the output can be different each time you run the code. This simulates the randomness associated with flipping a real coin, where the outcome is uncertain.

"""


# Generate a random float between 0 and 1
"""
random_float = random.random(): This line calls the random.random() function, which returns a random floating-point number in the range [0.0, 1.0). The returned value is assigned to the variable random_float.

print(random_float): This line prints the value stored in the random_float variable, which is the randomly generated floating-point number.

The output of this code will be a random decimal number between 0 and just under 1. Since the upper bound (1.0) is exclusive, the generated number can be any value in the range [0.0, 1.0), but it will never actually be 1.0. Each time you run the code, you will get a different random number within this range.

"""
import random
random_float = random.random()
print(random_float)

"""
    In this example, random.uniform(1.1, 2.0) generates a random floating-point number between 1.1 (inclusive) and 2.0 (inclusive), which guarantees that the generated number is greater than 1.0.

You can adjust the range [1.1, 2.0] as needed to suit your specific requirements. Just make sure that the lower bound is greater than 1.0.

"""
import random

random_float = random.uniform(1.1, 2.0)  # Any range that starts above 1.0
print(random_float)


# Generate a random integer between 1 and 10
random_integer = random.randint(1, 10)
print(random_integer)

# Shuffle a list randomly
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
random.shuffle(my_list)
for list in my_list:
    print(list)
# If we don't want the program to show to brackets and all then we can just use the for loop.
"""
In this example, random.sample() will select 3 unique elements from the population list and print them as the random sample. Since the k parameter is set to 3, the resulting random_sample will contain 3 elements, and each element will be unique.

"""
import random

population = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
sample_size = 3

random_sample = random.sample(population, sample_size)
print(random_sample)

# We also use it like this 'random_sample = random.sample(population, 3)'
"""
Certainly, here's a summary of the common random-related concepts and functions in Python:

random Module: The random module in Python provides functions for generating random values. It's part of the standard library and used for various randomization tasks.

random.random(): This function generates a random floating-point number in the range [0.0, 1.0). The generated value will be between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

random.randint(a, b): Generates a random integer between a and b, inclusive. The generated integer will be within the specified range.

random.uniform(a, b): Generates a random floating-point number between a and b. Both a and b are inclusive bounds.

random.choice(sequence): Picks a random element from the given sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string).

random.sample(population, k): Generates a list of k unique random elements from the given population.

random.shuffle(sequence): Shuffles the elements of a sequence randomly, altering the original sequence.

Seeding the Random Number Generator:

random.seed(seed): Sets the seed for the random number generator, ensuring reproducible random sequences when the same seed is used.
Cryptographically Secure Randomness:

For cryptographic applications, use the secrets module, which provides functions for generating cryptographically secure random values.

import random

coin = random.choice(['Heads', 'Tails'])

# Could we implement this in a different way. This time we will use a new keyword. 'from'.

# Introduction to from.
"""
    From is a keyword in Python that we can use when importing functions from a module.
    But it allows us to be more specific than import alone.

    The difference between them is when we use 'import random' we are technically importing everything from the 'random' module.
    Not just the function 'random.choice' but few other functions as well.

        If we use import then we always have to call the functions out like 'random.choice', 'random.shuffle' etc.
            But don't have to do that in the 'from' keyword.

"""

# If we use 'from random import choice' and what it does effectively is it loads the functions name choice into our current namespace into the scope of the file we are working in.
# That means is that I now no longer have to spacify which choice function I mean. I can just say choice.

from random import choice

coin = choice(['Heads', 'tails']) #  I can just say choice.

print(coin)
# Sometimes it's better to just import the functions.
"""
There is not necessarily one right approch or another it depends but I think for those very reasons sometimes it's better to do what we did the first time which is only import the module.
So that it all the scopes so that we can can use them when the time comes.

# Introduction to Statistics
"""
    Python also comes with a statistics library. This functions are used for doing things more statistical in nature.
    Namely calculating means or medians or other aspects of data set that we might want to analyze.
"""
# Let's do an average of numbers.

import statistics
numbers=[100, 0, 900000]

average = statistics.mean(numbers)
print(average)
# We could also use the round function with the statistics modules or any kind of function that deals with numbers.

x = round(average)
print(f"{x:,}")
# We could also use the round function and use the comma as the indicators at the same time.

# Also instead of all that we can just type 'print(statistics.mean([100, 0, 900000]))'
print(statistics.mean([100, 0, 900000]))
# If we want to use the round function and the comma like before and not create the variables then the code will be like this_

print(f"{round(statistics.mean([100, 0, 900000])):,}")
# But this code would be too difficult to follow and understand.
# So in this case we better use this code by creating variables.

# There is new module named 'sys'.
# The sys module in Python is a built-in module that provides access to various system-specific parameters and functions.
# It provides an interface to the interpreter, allowing you to interact with the Python runtime environment and get information about the system where your Python script is running.

# let's go through each of the functions from the sys module, explaining what they do, providing examples, and showing the expected outputs.

# Introduction to sys.argv

# To use this function we can't just run this function.
# We have to go to the terminal and then we have to type 'python [file name] [input that I'll give]'
# Because we have to the input to the program before it starts.


# Introduction to the 'argv' function.
"""
This is a list in Python that contains the command-line arguments passed to a script when it's executed from the command line.
The first element (sys.argv[0]) is the name of the script itself. As we know the counting starts from 0 in python.
And our input goes with [1]
"""
import sys

print("Hello, my name is", sys.argv[1])
# By sys.argv[1] we are actually calling our first input. By [2], the second and so on and so on.

import sys

print("Number of command-line arguments:", len(sys.argv))
print("Script name:", sys.argv[0])
if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    print("First argument:", sys.argv[1])

print("My full name is", sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], sys.argv[3], sys.argv[4])
"""
    Here if we put 2 words as input then the 'Number of command-line arguments' will be 3.
        Because the name the code itself also gets itself as input because we are actually calling out the code to activate.
    And then we are printing the our first input as the script name.

    After that we are scanning the number of the input with 'len' function.
        Then if it turns out to be more than one then it prints the 2nd input, our actual input as we speak.

"""
import sys

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print("Too few input.")
elif len(sys.argv) > 2:
    print("Too many input.")
else:
    print("My name is", sys.argv[1])



# We could also leave or exit the program as long as it doesn't fit the requirements.
# To do that introducing a new function called 'sys.exit'. It means that we are just exiting the program.

# How the function works is_
"""
    if len(sys.argv) > 2:
        sys.exit("too few arguments.")

            We are just exiting the program as the input doesn't fulfill our demands.
            And no further code will be of deployment.

# What if we want to erase the lase name also and print the middle part.

"""

"""

for arg in sys.argv[1:-2]:
    print("My name is", arg)

# What it does is it just erases the input according to the limit we give in the 'sys.argv[1:-2]'
# If we type in 'python practice.py boom balal vom voa' then we will get 'boom' and 'balal'.
# There is a lot of functions within 'sys' module. We can get those info by chatgpt.
# Introduction to pip
"""
    There is a lot of other functions that can be used in python but they are actually not included in python.
    We have to install them manually.
     The CS50 themselves have their own module. It's known as 'cowsay'.
     It's usually used to print our input but it actually shows that a cow is saying it to us.

"""

"""
Pip is a package manager for Python that allows you to easily install and manage Python libraries (also known as packages or modules) from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other sources.
 Pip provides several functions and commands to help you work with Python packages. Here are some commonly used pip functions and their explanations:

"""
# To install the 'cowsay' we have to go to the command line.
# We to type 'pip install [module name]'
# In this case module name = cowsay
# And then we will call out the '.cow' function. And use it as the print function.

import cowsay
import sys

if len(sys.argv) == 2:
    cowsay.cow("Happy Birthday, " + sys.argv[1])
    cowsay.cow(f"Katla says he and you gae. {sys.argv[1]}" )

# We are going to call out the 'cow' function in the package called 'cowsay' and just use it as the print function.

# We can also use it to print not just a cow but also a trex.
# We just have to code 'cowsay.trex('input')'

import cowsay
import sys

if len(sys.argv) == 2:
    cowsay.trex(f"Happy birthday, {sys.argv[1]}")
    cowsay.kitty("Katla says he n u roommate?")

"""
    Here what we did is we are constantly changing the output style formula but the actual printing formula stays the same.
        If we want cow then we code 'cowsay.cow()',
        trex = cowsay.trex()
        cat = cowsay.kitty()
"""

# Now that we know how to install the no modules. Then let's install some new modules.
"""
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
 It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
 APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.
 Here are some key points to understand about APIs:
"""
# API is an application programming interface. But often API is refer to third-party services that we write code that talk to.
"""
How this works is_
    We write code that pretends to be a browser which connects to that third party API on a server.
    Then it downloads the data that we can incorporate into our own program.
"""
# To use it we have to use a new package/module. It is really popular package that we can install via pip called 'requests'.
# The 'request' library allows us to make web request using python code essentially as though we are a browser ourselves.
#  We are gonna us URL that starts with 'http'/'https'. Let's start.

# Let's try a URL 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit=<LIMIT>

# If we run this url on the browser we actually end up with a text file on the download section on our mac.
# If we enter the text file then wew see a lot of text. Which will look a bit criptic but it actually follows a pattern. \

"""
Those are actually a source code or something like that. Those are a text format known as 'JSON'
    'Javascript object notation.'
    It is related to a new language called javascript.
But JSON itself is nowadays used as a language agnostic format for exchanging data between computers.
    So we don't have to  use javascript, we can use python or any other language to read JSON or write it as well.

"""
import requests
import sys
import json

if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    sys.exit("Input not valid.")

response = requests.get(f"https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit={sys.argv[2]}&term=" + sys.argv[1])

o = response.json()
print(f"Here is a list of {sys.argv[2]} songs of {sys.argv[1]}_")
for result in o["results"]:
    print(result["trackName"])

# what we did here is we are calling the 'get' function to get the information from the server.
# And then we are putting the input into the response variable and then printing it with the 'json' format.
# That is why we called out '.json'
"""
o appears to be a dictionary that contains a key named "results." This key likely maps to a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing information about a track.

The for loop iterates through each element (result) in the list associated with the "results" key.

Inside the loop, result["trackName"] accesses the value associated with the key "trackName" in the current dictionary (result), which presumably contains the name of a track.

print(result["trackName"]) then prints the track name to the console for each iteration of the loop.
"""

"""
    What happens is the whole response thing is a list of a lot of list.
        So we are first selecting the list in the response that contains the result.
        And then we are printing the list into the 'result' and printing the key that contains the trackNames.
    Summery_
    1. Entering o
    2. Going to 'results'
    3. Going to 'trackName'
    4. printing the objects that stays in 'trackname'

"""
# We have to be extra careful with the key names.
# Creating our own module like 'random', 'sys', 'json', 'request'.
# We are now creating another file and we are going to create out modules there.
# We are going to import the module from there.

# We are now creating a new function called 'saying.py'.

import sys

from saying import hello

if len(sys.argv) == 2:
    hello(sys.argv[1])

# We are now facing a weird kind of error.
"""
    On that file_
    the code is like_
        def main():
            hello("world")
            goodbye("world")

        def hello(name):
            print(f"Hello, {name}. ")

        def goodbye(name):
            print(f"Goodbye, {name}. ")

        main()
        then the output will be_
            input_python practice.py tamjid
                Hello, world.
                Goodbye, world.
                Hello, tamjid.

    We are seeing hello world and goodbye world and then we are seeing hello tamjid.
    But what we actually wanted is just 'hello, tamjid'.

    So we can deffinatly say that it's just not the way that we do it.
"""
# It's not right to call out main at the end after all.
# Even if we are importing a file or just a function from the file.
"""
    If we say 'from saying import hello' we are actually saying python to go find that module saying.py.
    Read it from top to bottom and left to right and import the hello function specifically.
    And at the end the 'call main', main gets called no matter what.
"""
# To solve it we have to do the following_
"""
def main():
    hello("world")
    goodbye("world")

def hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}. ")

def goodbye(name):
    print(f"Goodbye, {name}. ")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
 # There is 2 underscores. We may find it hard to see in vs code
# As it turns out this '__name__' variable is a special symbol in python.
# It makes python to go to the target that we want it to go.

When you run a Python script directly (e.g., by typing python script.py in the command line), the __name__ variable is set to "__main__".

When a Python script is imported as a module into another script, the __name__ variable is set to the name of the script (without the ".py" extension).

So, you can use if __name__ == "__main__": in your script to specify what code should run only when the script is the main program, and not when it's imported as a module.
 This helps keep your code organized and separate the parts meant for execution and parts meant for reuse in other scripts.

Importing Libraries:

import sys: This imports the sys module, which provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact with the interpreter.
from PIL import Image: This imports the Image class from the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which is used for opening, manipulating, and saving image files.
Initialization:

images = []: This initializes an empty list named images where we will store the images that will be used to create the animated GIF.

"""
"""
Looping Through Command Line Arguments:
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:: This loop iterates over the command-line arguments passed when the script is run. sys.argv[1:] excludes the first argument, which is the script name itself.
Opening and Appending Images:
image = Image.open(arg): This opens an image file specified by the command-line argument arg and assigns it to the variable image.
images.append(image): This appends the opened image to the images list.

"""
"""
Saving the Animated GIF:
images[0].save(...): This line is trying to save an animated GIF using the first image from the list.

save_all=True: This parameter specifies that all frames (images) should be saved in the output GIF.

append_images=images[1:]: This includes all the subsequent images in the GIF.

duration=200: This sets the duration of each frame in milliseconds (200 milliseconds in this case).

loop=0: This specifies that the animation should loop indefinitely.

"costumes.gif": This is the output file name for the animated GIF.

"""
"""
The line append_images=images[1:] is used to include all images except the first one in the creation of the animated GIF.

Here's why:

images[1:] returns a sublist of images starting from the second element (index 1) to the last element. This is achieved using slicing.

In the context of creating an animated GIF, this means that all images from the second one onwards will be included in the animation.

If we used images[1] instead, it would only include the second image. This would result in a GIF with only two frames - the first frame being the base image (index 0) and the second frame being the second image (index 1).

By using images[1:], we ensure that all images provided in the command-line arguments are included in the final animated GIF, resulting in a smoother animation with multiple frames.

"""
    Let's break down the code:

    if: This is a conditional statement in Python. It allows you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true.

    re.search(pattern, string): This is a function call to the search function from the re module. It searches for a specified pattern (regular expression) within a string. In this case, it's used to search for a specific pattern in the email string.

    r"^\w+@(\w+\.)?\w+\.(edu|com|org|net|co)$": This is a regular expression pattern. Let's break it down:

    r": Indicates that this is a raw string, which allows for easier handling of backslashes in regular expressions.
    ^: Asserts the start of a line.
    \w+: Matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores). This represents the username part of an email address.
    @: Matches the literal "@" symbol.
    (\w+\.)?: This is a non-capturing group ( )?. It matches zero or one occurrence of the group. In this case, it matches an optional group that contains one or more word characters followed by a dot. This is for handling subdomains in the domain name (e.g., subdomain.example.com).
    \w+: Matches one or more word characters. This represents the main domain name part before the dot (e.g., "example" in "example.com").
    \.: Matches a literal dot (".") character.
    (edu|com|org|net|co): This is an alternation ( ) group that matches one of the specified options inside the parentheses. In this case, it matches "edu", "com", "org", "net", or "co".
    $: Asserts the end of a line.
    So, this regular expression pattern is designed to match email addresses that have a specific format: <username>@<subdomain>.<domain>.<extension>, where the domain extension can be "edu", "com", "org", "net", or "co".

    email.lower(): This converts the entire email address to lowercase. This ensures that the regular expression pattern matches regardless of the case of the email address. For example, "example@domain.com" and "Example@Domain.com" would both be considered valid.

    If the regular expression pattern matches the provided email address, the if condition is considered true, and the code block within the if statement will be executed (i.e., print("Valid")). Otherwise, if the pattern does not match, the else block will be executed (i.e., print("Invalid")).

"""
 Let's go through the code step by step:

    import re: This line imports the regular expressions (regex) module, re, which provides functions for working with regular expressions.

    name = input("What's your name? ").strip(): This line prompts the user to enter their name and then assigns the input to the variable name. The .strip() method is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the input. This ensures that there are no unwanted spaces affecting the name.

    matches = re.search(r"^(.+), (.+)$", name): This line uses a regular expression pattern to search for a specific pattern in the name string. Let's break down the pattern:

    ^: Asserts the start of a line.
    (.+): This is a capturing group ( ) that matches one or more occurrences + of any character . (except for a newline). This represents the last name.
    In the regular expression ^(.+), (.+)$, the (.+) parts are called "capturing groups". They are used to capture (or extract) specific portions of the matched text.

    , : Matches a comma and a space.
    (.+): Another capturing group that matches one or more occurrences of any character. This represents the first name.
    $: Asserts the end of a line.
    The regular expression pattern is designed to match names in the format "Last, First".

    If a match is found, re.search() returns a match object. If no match is found, it returns None. The match object is then assigned to the variable matches.

    if matches:: This checks whether a match was found. If a match was found (meaning matches is not None), the condition is considered true.

    last, first = matches.groups(): If there was a match, this line extracts the captured groups (last name and first name) from the match object.

    name = f"{first} {last}": This line reassigns the name variable with the first name and last name reversed and separated by a space.

    print(f"Hello, {name}"): Finally, this line prints a greeting message using the modified name.

    In summary, the code prompts the user for their name, expects it to be in the format "Last, First", rearranges it to "First Last", and then greets the user using the modified name. If the user enters a name in a different format, the code won't perform the rearrangement.

"""
    last, first = matches.groups()
      If we do this it'll automatically allocate the "first" into to the matching group 2, because we listed it out after the 'last'.
    But in the second code, made it clear that we can control that too.

"""
    By "if matches:
        name = matches.group(2) + " " + matches.group(1)"

    It means if the given conditions match, we are now overriding the 'name' string. And the captured groups will be divided.
    The first one is group one and the second one is second. 
        Now the new variable is_
            group 1 and 'space' then group 2.

        followed by an optional www. ((www\.)?), and then twitter.com/.
    When you apply this pattern to the input 'https://twitter.com/elonmusk', it matches and removes 'https://twitter.com/', leaving 'elonmusk'.

"""
    If we use the dollar sign here then program will just fail.
    This pattern is similar to the first one, but it has an additional $ at the end. 
    In regular expressions, $ represents the end of a line or string. 
    This means the pattern will only match URLs that end with twitter.com/.
    When you apply this pattern to the input 'https://twitter.com/elonmusk', it doesn't match because the URL doesn't end with twitter.com/. Therefore, the replacement doesn't happen, and the original URL is returned.    

"""

# But there still remains arguable at least one problem with this solution in that.
# Even though we are calling 're.sub' to substitute the URL with nothing by using ' "" '

# And then we are blindly hoping that it'll work.

"""
    But what if the user instead of giving the URL of twitter, he gives something else.
    What if they do something like that_ https://www.google.com/   (completely unrelated)
        Then if we run this then we see that it just prints exactly that.

    we are actually returning one value which is a 'tuple'.

        It is similiar spirit of returning one list with two things. The comma here tells python that we indeed want to return a tuple.

"""

# Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:
"""
    1. Class Definition:
        class Student:
        Defines a class named Student.

    2. Constructor Method:

            def __init__(self, name, house):
                if not name:
                    raise ValueError("Invalid name")
                self.name = name
                self.house = house
    The __init__ method is the constructor method, which initializes a new instance of the class.
    It takes two parameters: name and house.
    It first checks if the provided name is not empty. If it is empty, it raises a ValueError.
    It then assigns name and house to the respective attributes of the instance (self).
    Note: In the original code, self.house is used to call the setter method. This could lead to a recursive call and an error. I've corrected it in the explanation

    3. String Representation Method:
            def __str__(self):
                return f"{self.name} from {self.house}"
    The __str__ method defines how the class should be represented as a string when using print or similar functions.
    In this case, it returns a formatted string containing the name and house of the student.

    4. Getter Method using Property:
            @property
            def house(self):
                return self._house
    This is a getter method for the house attribute.
    The @property decorator is used to define a method as a "getter". It allows you to access the method like an attribute.
    The getter returns the value of the private attribute _house.

    5. Setter Method using Property:
        @house.setter
        def house(self, house):
            if house not in ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]:
                raise ValueError("Invalid house")
            self._house = house 
        This is a setter method for the house attribute.
        The @house.setter decorator is used to define a method as a "setter".
        The setter method takes a parameter house, representing the new value.
        It first checks if the provided house is one of the valid options. If not, it raises a ValueError.
        If the value is valid, it assigns it to the private attribute _house.

    
    6. Main Function and User Input:
         def main():
            student = get_student()
            print(student)
        The main function is defined to demonstrate the usage of the Student class.
        It calls the get_student function to get user input for creating a student instance and then prints it.
    

    7. Function to Create Student:
         def get_student():
            name = input("Name: ")
            house = input("House: ")
            return Student(name, house)
        The get_student function prompts the user for a name and house, and then creates and returns a Student object.
     

    8. Running the Program:
            if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()


This block ensures that the main function is executed when the script is run directly (not imported as a module).
Overall, this code defines a Student class with a getter and setter method for the house attribute, ensuring that the house is one of the valid options. It also provides a way to create a Student object and print its information.
           

        
"""



# If we run the program now then, we are still going to see the errors.
"""
    Let's type in gryffindor which will at least pass our checks that's induced by init.
    But the line 24 is going to trigger the same setter to be called and the ValueError is going to be raised.

"""
# What is the solution to that then?
# We can change the 'student.house' to the 'student._house'
# Because the instance variable is now called the '_house'. The property is called 'house' no '_'. 

# But the "_" attribute implemented as an instance variable is still called 'underscore house'


# Now if we run the code then_

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, house):
        if not name:
            raise ValueError("Invalid name")
        self.name = name
        self.house = house

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} from {self.house}"
# Getter
    @property
    def house(self):
        return self._house
# Setter
    @house.setter
    def house(self, house):
        if house not in ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]:
            raise ValueError("Invalid house")
        self._house = house 

def main():
    student = get_student()
    student._house = "Number Four, Privet Drive"     # We added the underscore to make sure that it is an instance variable. 
    print(student)


def get_student():
    name = input("Name: ")
    house = input("House: ")
    return Student(name, house)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
# Now we slipped through the ValueError.

"""
    Python itself allows you to specify that certain instance variables can be public and accessible to anyone's code.
    Or protected or private which means that no one else should be able to change this values

    That's the underscore.
        In python if a instance variable starts with an underscore starts with an underscore_
            DON'T TOUCH IT.
        The underscore is meant to signify a convention that this is meant to be private but it really means 'please don't touch this.' 

    
    Sometimes there is 2 underscores which we can use too.
        That's even greated effort by the coder to say "REALLY DON'T TOUCH THIS".
    But there is nothing in python which is stopping you or me from circumventing all of these mechanisms.

        
"""

"""
    Single Underscore Prefix _var:

    A single underscore at the beginning of a variable or method name (_var) is a convention indicating that the variable or method is intended for internal use or it's a non-public part of the API.
    It's a signal to the programmer that this variable or method is considered "protected" and should not be accessed directly from outside the class/module. However, it's not enforced by the Python interpreter.
    
    
    Double Underscore Prefix __var:

    A double underscore at the beginning of a variable name (__var) triggers name mangling. Python will rename the variable in a way that makes it harder to create subclasses that accidentally override private attributes and methods.
    This is not to make it "private" in the strictest sense, but rather to avoid name conflicts in subclasses. The actual name is transformed to _classname__var, where "classname" is the name of the current class. This makes it less likely that a subclass will accidentally override a private attribute.
"""

# It might come as quite a surprise that even though might have identified OOP by name now.
# But we've all been using classes and objects forever now in this class.

"""
    In fact if we think back on one of the very first things we did in the class, we used integers.
    And just got integers from the user.
        But if we see the docutmentation for integers_ "docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int"
            We can actually find int itself is and has been for weeks a class and in fact this is the signature of the constructor call for an INT
"""
"""
    In fact_ "class int(x, base=10)"
    This is the signature of the constructor  call for an int where by we pass in x 
"""

# Strings too are also a class. If you have used str.lower(), 
# you were using a method that came within the str class. 
# You can learn more in Python’s documentation of str.


# list is also a class. Looking at that documentation for list, you can see the methods that are contained therein, like list.append().
# You can learn more in Python’s documentation of list.

# dict is also a class within Python. You can learn more in Python’s documentation of dict.

# To see how you have been using classes all along, go to your console and type code type.py and then code as follows:
print(type(50))

# We are going to see something like this "<class 'int'>"
# Notice how by executing this code, it will display that the class of 50 is int.


    # The program actually prints out the type of the number 50.
        # It is not something we want to show to the user. 

# Write if we write code something like this_
print(type("Hello, world"))
# Now we are going to see something like this_"<class 'str'>"
    # There it is. We can now see that the str is also a class

# We can do this a lot of staffs_
print(type([]))

    # There it is. We can now see that the list is also a class

print(type(list()))
# Here we go again_"<class 'list'>"
    
# Let's do dictionary then_
print(type({}))
# This code will indicate this is of the class dict

# As the list we can just do the same here too.
print(type(dict()))
# This code will also indicate this is of the class dict.

# Sometimes, wa want to add functionality to ac class itself,l not to instances of that class.

# "@classmethod" is a function that we can use to add functionality to class as whole.

# Introduction to Inheritence.

# Inheritence is perhaps the most powerful feature of object oriented programming.

"""
    Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class (the child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the parent or superclass). 
    This enables the child class to reuse and extend the functionality of the parent class.
"""

# It just so happens that you can create a class that “inherits” methods, variables, and attributes from another class

# Both students and professors are at the end of the day wizards. So now we combined both of the classes.
# We defined a third class for instance called wizaed that has any of the common attributes for students and professors

# But the only thing they have in common is a name and a name in student and professor respectively.

student = Student("Harry", "Gryffindor")                                # We fixed the values
professor = Professor("Severus", "Defence Against the Dark Arts")

# Here a student inherits from or is a subclass of wizard which conversely is the superclass of the student class.

# The 'Student(Wizard)' means when I define a student class go ahead and and inherit all of the characteristics of the Wizard as well.
# We are going to do the same thing for professor too.

# Also we want to fix that we also want to use the functionality in the wizard classes init method.

"""
    The way to do that is as follows.
    Let's go to the init method of the student. And we are going to call a funtion called "super()"

    So if this class if Student the super class aka the parent class is wizard. We are now actually connected with the super class but now we have to access into the objects.

    To do so_
    we did this 'super().__init__(name)'
        By this we accessed the init method of the super class and called the name of the class.
    And we are gonna do the same in the Professor class.

"""
# While we have just introduced inheritance, we have been using this all along during our use of exceptions.

# It just so happens that exceptions come in a heirarchy, where there are children, parent, and grandparent classes. These are illustrated below:
"""
BaseException
 +-- KeyboardInterrupt
 +-- Exception
